<h1>Central Valley Pottery Studio</h1>

	<h3>Brief Introduction</h3>

<p>Central Valley Pottery Studio combines a pottery teaching studio with a gallery
showcasing the works of many Central Valley potters. Classes in wheelthrowing,
handbuilding, and tile making are offered to adults in 8-10 week sessions. Children can
participate in monthly parent/child classes and summer camps. Workshops are offered by
local and nationally-known potters. Private lessons can also be arranged. The gallery
includes functional, decorative stoneware and earthenware at surprisingly reasonable
prices.</p>
